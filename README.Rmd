# 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of **political opinions** online

### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of **political opinions** online: Questions and challenges

The *Cloud* layer (Bratton, 2016) is the extensive network infrastructure powered by Internet technologies and services (e.g. social media).

#### Key research questions

* What opinions do **emerge** online, but also when and where?

* How do opinions **interact** with other opinions through the Cloud and its online communities?

* What factors determine the speed and reach of the **diffusion** of opinions? 

#### Key methodological challanges

* How to collect complete data about social media interactions?
  * API, web scraping, platforms' research tools, third-parties research tools... 
  
* How to collect representative data?

* How to create collaborative tools? 
  * Interface between qualitative data and quantitative/machine-ready data

# 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on **political participation and organisation**

---

### 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on **political participation and organisation**: Questions 

#### Key research questions

* Can "Internet capital" offset a lack of social capital in facilitating participation and organisation?

  * Does Internet capital facilitate the organisation of political discontent from the margin (low-social capital areas)?

* Do Internet technologies and services create more political instability by facilitating the emergence of new political actors (individuals or organisations)?
  
* Do social media negatively affect the quality of political deliberation? What factors, technologies or services are important in reducing the quality of online conversation?
